# OneSharer
This app was intended to be a single stop for sharing on multiple social networks.
Currently this app has only facebook and twitter. 
I have used Linq2Twitter library for oauth and posting on twitter, and native HttpClient for oauth and posting on facebook.
To use and modify, add your respective Facebook and twitter API keys in TokenUtility.cs and AuthService.cs
